#' Shaming Your Neighbor - A Catalyst to Civic Action?
#'
#' This is a dataset corresponding to the paper "Social Pressure and Voter
#' Turnout: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment" by
#' \href{https://doi.org/10.1017/S000305540808009X}{Gerber, Green, and Larimer
#' (2008)}. See also the 'Details' section below. The aim of the study was to
#' find out whether and to what extent people are motivated to vote by social
#' pressure. To answer this question, the authors conducted a field experiment
#' prior to the August 2006 primary election in Michigan. A total of 180,000
#' households were randomly assigned to either a control group or one of four
#' treatment groups. The control group consisted of approximately 100,000
#' households and was observed without further intervention.
#'
#' The treatment groups consisted of about 20,000 households each, and were sent
#' one mailing 11 days prior to the primary election. The first treatment group,
#' named “Civic Duty”, received a letter that only reminded them to "do their
#' civic duty and vote". The second treatment group, named "Hawthorne", received
#' the same message with an additional notice that they are being studied by
#' researchers. The letter sent to the third group, named "Self", included the
#' content in the Hawthorne letter, but added a notice that every household
#' member would be notified of each others' voting behaviour after the election
#' (this information is public). The last group, "Neighbors", finally listed not
#' only the household's voting records but also the voting records of those
#' nearby. As in the "Self" group, everyone on the list would be notified of
#' their voting behaviour after the primary.
